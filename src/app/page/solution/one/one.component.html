<h2>How Does a Fixed Deposit Work? Is it safe to invest in a Fixed Deposit? </h2>
<p>A Fixed Deposit (FD) is one of the safest investment options as market fluctuations do not impact the interest rates. The tenure and investment amount predetermine the interest rate in a fixed deposit. A fixed deposit also helps you to develop a healthy savings habit and earn interest on the deposit. </p>

<p> A fixed deposit allows an investor to grow their finances over a set tenure. A high interest rate should be the top priority when selecting an FD. You can choose between a cumulative or non-cumulative type of fixed deposit according to the interest payout required.</p>

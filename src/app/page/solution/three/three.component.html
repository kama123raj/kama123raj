    <h2>Benefits of Cumulative Fixed Deposit</h2>
    <h2 class="sub-cont-head">One Time Investment</h2>
    <p>Investing in a Fixed Deposit is the most preferred form of investment. An investor needs to make a lump sum amount as a deposit, select their tenure range, the interest rate pay-out, and eventually, the funds are accumulated over a period of time. At the time of maturity, the principal amount and the compounded interest are provided to the investor. The best part about investing in a cumulative FD is that it is a one-time investment wherein the depositor gets assured returns with an attractive interest rate.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>How is the Cumulative FD Interest Calculated?</h2>
    <p>When it comes to the Cumulative FD Plan, the interest earned each year is invested back or added back to the fixed deposit, a process known as compounding. The ability to maximise your ROI is made possible by compounding interest.</p>
    <p>To better understand the idea, let's look at an example.</p>
    <p>Assume Akash, a depositor, begins a fixed deposit with Shriram for one lakh rupees with a five-year term. He will earn an effective yield of 10.71%*p.a. with an interest rate of 8.60%*p.a. Based on this, he will receive an interest payment of 9.02%*p.a. each year.</p>
    <p>The interest is therefore calculated as follows: (Effective Yield interest rate - The rate of interest) (/) (Tenure of the FD)<br>10.71% - 8.60% = 2.11%<br>2.11 (÷) 5 = 0.422<br>This 0.422 results in an interest rate of 9.022%* pa when added to the interest rate of 8.60%*p.a.</p>

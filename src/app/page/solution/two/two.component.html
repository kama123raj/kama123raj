<h2>6 Things to know before investing in an FD instead of RD! </h2>
<div class="article-definiton">
    <p><em>A Fixed Deposit (FD) and Recurring Deposit (RD) are the safest investment options in India. One of the significant advantages of investing in an FD and RD is that there are assured returns at a fixed interest rate. Investors can deposit a lump sum of money in Shriram Fixed Deposit or a bank fixed deposit to attain growth at zero risk. A fixed deposit and recurring deposit are safer for investment because they are not market-dependent and provide a higher rate of return throughout the investment tenure.</em></p>
    <p>FD and RD guarantee returns at maturity. However, when comparing FD vs RD, one can find that a fixed deposit offers higher interest rates that help earn higher returns than a recurring deposit. Investors can park their idle funds from savings accounts by opening an FD account with Shriram and reap excellent benefits in the future.</p>
    <p>As RD vs FD is the most popular topic when it comes to the choice of a safer investment option, let us discuss the difference between FD and RD and find which is a better option to invest in.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a Fixed Deposit?</h2>
    <p>A fixed deposit is an investment option offered by banks, NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) and other financial institutions through which investors can grow considerable savings at a fixed interest rate. A fixed deposit is a safer investment option compared to Mutual Funds (MFs), Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and Stocks. An FD assures higher returns at a fixed interest rate, offers additional FD interest rates for senior citizens, grants regular payout options, allows loans against an FD and does not expose FD funds to market risks.</p>
    <p>Generally, the tenure of a fixed deposit ranges from 7 days – 10 years. However, most banks and NBFCs commonly offer a fixed deposit for 5 years. The FD interest rates remain stable throughout the tenure, and investors can use an online FD calculator to calculate the exact maturity amount.</p>
    <p>Shriram Fixed Deposit offers an attractive interest rate of up to 8.75% per annum, including the 0.50% interest rate for senior citizens.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>What is a Recurring Deposit?</h2>
    <p>A recurring deposit is a risk-free investment option where investors can deposit a fixed amount every month for a tenure ranging between 6 months to 10 years. The tenure of a recurring deposit varies among respective banks and NBFCs. The RD interest rates remain stable throughout the tenure, and you can withdraw the total principal and accrued interest only at maturity. The features and benefits of an RD are the same as that of an FD. However, the interest rates of a fixed deposit are higher than a recurring deposit.</p>
    <p>Shriram Recurring Deposit offers a lucrative interest rate of up to 8.50% per annum for a maximum tenure of 5 years. Like a fixed deposit account, you can make premature withdrawals from your recurring deposit account with a minimal penalty.</p>

    <h2>FD vs RD: Which is a Better Option to Invest?</h2>
    <p>Now, you know that one can earn more in a fixed deposit than in a recurring deposit. However, before making an investment decision between FD and RD, there are various factors you should consider like, your financial goals, investment amount and the tenure of the deposit.</p>
    <p>If you have a lump sum of money and have future plans to purchase a house, save for children’s higher education, or plan a secure retirement, an FD is the best choice. You will gain a higher interest rate during the FD tenure and receive a considerable amount (principal + accrued interest) at maturity.</p>
    <p>In a fixed deposit, there are commonly two types as follows; cumulative and non-cumulative fixed deposit. A cumulative fixed deposit is the most beneficial as your interest will be calculated using compounding interest calculation.</p>
    <p>A recurring deposit is the best choice if you have a small amount of money idle every month and want to start a secure investment plan.</p>
